CSCE 240 Report
So originally I attempted to use a webscraper in order to get the data from the website and save it
as a local file before reading the data. However, there was difficulty in getting the exact
number of lines, words, and characters to be correct. So I instead opted to save the files locally
and then retrieve the information from them. I opened Coinbase2022.txt and read line by line,
each iteration adding one to the number of lines. I would add the length of the line split by spaces
to the number of words, and add the length of the line to the number of characters. I confirmed that
the data was correct by copy and pasting the entire file into an online line/word counter. For the
parts statistic portion, I looked into the file and noticed that the part numbers were written as 
"PART (roman numeral)". To get the number of parts I would splice the lines with the "PART", use
the index of the next item in the array to get the roman numeral, then use the roman library's
fromRoman() function to get a number. If that number was greater than the number of parts then then
the number of parts was replaced with that number. I then printed all of that information to the 
Companystats.txt file and did the same for CampbellSoup2022.txt. The only thing I changed for the
Campbell soup statistics was that it would append to the Companystats.txt file instead of overwriting.
This would make sure that the two companies would have their stats properly displayed in the Companystats.txt 
file.
