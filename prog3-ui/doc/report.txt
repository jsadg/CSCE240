CSCE 240 Prog3 Report

To run in terminal change directory into the Prog3-ui and then run with python src/main.py
Changes will be made to the output.txt file in the data folder

When ran the program asks the user to input a question with a company name included or to enter 0 
to quit. The available companys are listed in the terminal. If the user enters 0 then the program 
breaks out of a while loop and stops running. A valid company is identified if the question the
user inputs contains either Campbell or Coinbase as those are the two allowed companies. 
RegEx expressions are used to find which company was entered. If the user enters in a question
without a valid company name then they are asked to try again and the while loop repeats. Else if
the RegEx matches then the company is selected (If both are listed it defaults to Campbell Soup).
Then another group of RegExs try to match to the question and each one has keywords that pertain
to a particular section of the Form 10-K. If one of them matches then the relevant information is
printed out to the output.txt file in the data folder. If none of them match then the user is told
that no information in the Form 10-K matches their question. If more than one would match, then
the section higher in the file (Item 1 vs Item 9 for example) would be written to the file. After
printing to the file then the while loop repeats and the user is again asked what their question is.
The program is wrapped in a try-catch that will tell the user that their input is invalid if it 
errors and that they should try again.

Basically it's my design for prog2 but split up into classes to make it more easy to resue.
The ui class contains methods that are used to interact with the user and the file.
The statProcessor class is used to parse data and identify matches.
Some additional improvements were also made.
