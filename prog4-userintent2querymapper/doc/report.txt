CSCE 240 Prog4 Report

To run in terminal change directory into the Prog4-userintent2querymapper and then run with python src/main.py
Changes will be made to the output.txt file in the data folder

When ran the program asks the user to input a question with a company name included or to enter q 
to quit. The available companies are listed in the terminal. If the user enters q or quit then the program 
breaks out of a while loop and stops running. A valid company is identified if the question the
user inputs contains either Campbell or Coinbase as those are the two allowed companies. String matching using
the simpson coefficient is then used to find how close possible intents are to the user's question. If they match 
above a .7% threshold then the part that was close to their intent is printed to data/output.txt. If multiple 
part/items have the same matching percentage then the user is asked to which they want to choose. The one they 
choose is printed out. If there is nothing above the .7% threshold then the user is told that nothing was, 
and that they should try again. If no company name is detected then chit chat is checked for. Basic 
statements such as hello, or how is the weather are checked with string matching, and then an appropriate 
response is printed back if it matches enough.The various methods are broken up between the Processor 
class and the UI class. The UI class handles the user interaction such as printing a question, and the Processor 
class handles all of the computation. The classes are split this way to make reuse easier in the future.
