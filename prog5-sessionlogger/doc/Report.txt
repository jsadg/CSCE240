CSCE 240 Prog5 Report

Prog4 was copied over and modifications were made to it to store output as a data_time file in the chat_sessions 
folder. A new class called SessionStats was made to handle statistics of each session. One of its methods is called 
append_stats, which is used to include information about the session at the bottom of each chat in prog4. Another 
method called update_csv would use those statistics at the bottom of each file to create a csv of the statistcs.
The method parses through each file in the chat_sessions folder, gets the relevant statistics, and prints it to the
csv in the proper format. Other methods included in the SessionStats class would parse the csv file for information
needed to print out summary statistics or whole chats. When the sessionStatistics.py file is ran, the csv file is
updated and the user is presented with four options. 0 to quit, 1 to view a total summary, 2 to view a specific 
summary, 3 to view a chat, or 4 to update the csv file again. If they enter 0, the program terminates. Entering
1 will call the get_total_summary method from the SessionStats class which will print out a summary of all the 
stats in the csv file. Entering 2 prompts the user for a chat number, and if valid gives the stats for that
session from the csv. Entering 3 also prompts the user for a number, and if it is valid it takes the file name
from the csv and uses it to print that file to the terminal. Entering 4 updates the csv from the update_csv method
in the SessionStats class. The options will be presented continously until the user quits and is in a try except
to handle errors.
