CSCE 240 Prog6 Report

Reused code:
Tarun's Prog1 was copied over as a fileReader class and the scapeFile method is called before each time the company
file is read. 
Some of Ethan's intent map was used to improve my own and handle more queries

Project:
When the user runs the program they can either quit, enter a question, or type in a stats commands
Usage stats returns the stats for the current chat_sessions
Other stats opens up the statistics menu by calling the sessionStatistics file
-Several options within there, same as Pa5 basically
Enter 0 to quit
Enter 1 to view a summary of all the sessions
Enter 2 to view a specific session summary
Enter 3 to view a chat
Enter 4 to update the chat_statistics.csv file

When the user types in a question, a company name is looked for, and if found, then matches to the intent map
to find out what they want
If a high enough match ratio is found then the relevant part/item is printed to a chat session file

If a company name is not found than chit-chat is looked for in the same way and some queries are handled there
If nothing if found that matches, then the user is informed that no information matches
